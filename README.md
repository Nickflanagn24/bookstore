# Colour choices 

![Colour Pallet](assets/readme-images/tales-tails-colour-palette.jpg)


## Why These Colors Work Perfectly Together for Tales & Tails Bookstore

## The Science of Color Harmony

The Tales & Tails color palette is built on proven color theory principles that create both visual appeal and psychological comfort. Here's why these specific colors work so beautifully together:

---

### 1. Natural Color Relationships

#### Analogous Harmony  
The green family ‚Äî **Deep Forest Green** `#2D5A3D` and **Sage Green** `#8FA68E` ‚Äî creates an *analogous* color scheme (colors next to each other on the color wheel), leading to:

- Visual cohesion without monotony  
- Natural flow and organic progression  
- Calming effect that encourages browsing and reading  

#### Complementary Accents  
**Soft Gold** `#D4A574` complements the greens, offering:

- Visual excitement without being overwhelming  
- Natural contrast that draws attention  
- A sophisticated balance between warm and cool tones  

---

The palette connects with:

- Forest themes ‚Äî ideal for the *"Tales & Tails"* brand

### 4. Technical Colour Theory

#### Value Contrast (Light to Dark Range)
| Shade | Colour | Lightness |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| Light | Warm Cream `#F8F6F0` | 92% |
| Medium | Soft Gold `#D4A574` | 68% |
| Medium | Sage Green `#8FA68E` | 61% |

## Agile Project Planning with GitHub Projects

For the Tales & Tails bookstore e-commerce platform, I implemented an agile development approach using [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/Nickflanagn24/projects/6) as the central planning and tracking tool.

![GitHub Projects Board](assets/readme-images/planning/github-projects.png)

**Project Board Structure:**
- **Backlog:** Repository of all identified features, enhancements, and bug fixes
- **Sprint Planning:** Current sprint tasks with clear acceptance criteria and time estimates
- **In Progress:** Active development tasks with assigned developers and progress tracking
- **Code Review:** Completed features awaiting peer review and quality assurance
- **Testing:** Features undergoing comprehensive testing and user acceptance validation
- **Done:** Completed and deployed features ready for production environment

**Agile Implementation:**
Each feature is captured as an individual ticket containing comprehensive details including:
- **Type Classification:** User Story, Bug Fix, or Technical Enhancement
- **Priority Level:** Using MoSCoW method (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have)
- **Epic Association:** Grouping related functionality for better organisation
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Clear definition of completion requirements
- **Time Estimation:** Story points and expected development duration

This structured approach allows for effective prioritisation, focusing first on implementing critical components like the shopping cart system and user authentication before progressing to secondary features. As development advances, tickets move across the board maintaining real-time visual representation of project status, helping identify bottlenecks and adjust priorities as needed.

The ticketing system facilitates comprehensive documentation of bug fixes through dedicated tickets describing the issue, resolution approach, and verification process. By maintaining this structured view of all planned features and their current status, development remains focused on delivering core functionality while tracking potential enhancements for future iterations.

**Sprint Planning Process:**
- **Sprint Duration:** 2-week iterations with clearly defined deliverables
- **Daily Standups:** Progress updates and impediment identification
- **Sprint Reviews:** Feature demonstrations and stakeholder feedback
- **Retrospectives:** Process improvement and team collaboration enhancement

This agile approach enables rapid adaptation to challenges encountered during development while maintaining a clear path toward project completion with all essential features implemented according to the defined acceptance criteria and quality standards.
